# DataProjects

Hey! Just a brief introduction about myself.

My name is Will and I am currently a penultimate Data Science student majoring in Mathematics and Statistics. Having studied in the fields of Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics with a gentle introduction to Neuroscience research and personal finance projects, I am paritcularly interested in the fundamental building blocks of Machine Learning and how analytical methods are able to solve complex and logical problems.

I strive to uphold values of passion, confidence, active listening, kindness and professionalism with a particular aim of being one of the best in the field of Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence.
